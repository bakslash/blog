Installing Git

You can download installers for Git from the official Git website. On Linux systems, you can also install Git using that distribution’s package manager (apt-get on Ubuntu systems ). On OS X systems (recent releases, anyway), you can install Git by installing the “XCode command-line tools”. As far as I am aware, Windows systems require the installer from the Git web site. If you want to follow along with some of the example commands I’ll provide later in this post, go ahead and install Git on your system.
